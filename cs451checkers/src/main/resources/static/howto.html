    <p> 1. Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12 colored discs.</p>
    <p> 2. Each player places his or her pieces on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.</p>
    <p> 3. Black moves first. Players then alternate moves.</p>
    <p>A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move. In most cases,
        this is because all of the opponent's pieces have been captured</p>
